## Overview

MB Bank Transaction Monitor is a Python-based application that monitors MB Bank account transactions and sends real-time notifications to a Telegram group. The application checks for incoming transactions during configured operating hours, sends notifications when new transactions are detected, provides daily transaction summaries, and includes weather updates.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- Telegram bot token (obtained from [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather))
- MB Bank account credentials

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bphucc/MBBankTelegram.git
   
   cd MBBankTelegram
   ```

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On Linux/Mac
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

1. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. Create a `.env` file with your configuration:

   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_telegram_bot_token"
   
   TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID="your_telegram_group_id"
   
   WEATHER_API_KEY="your_weather_api_key"
   
   WEATHER_COORDINATES="lat_long_of_your_desired_location"
   
   ACCOUNT_INFO="your_account_number MBBank"
   ```

### Configuration

The application is configured using the `.env` file and the `config.py` module. Here are the key configuration options:

#### Environment Variables (in `.env`file)

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token
- `TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID`: ID of your Telegram group (must start with a minus sign if it's a group)
- `WEATHER_API_KEY`: API key from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
- `ACCOUNT_INFO`: Your account information to display in notifications

#### Application Settings (in `config.py`)

- `WEATHER_CHECK_INTERVAL`: How often to update weather (in seconds)
- `OPERATING_START_HOUR` and `OPERATING_START_MINUTE`: When to start monitoring each day
- `OPERATING_END_HOUR` and `OPERATING_END_MINUTE`: When to stop monitoring each day
- `CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: How often to check for new transactions
- `CONSOLE_CLEAR_INTERVAL`: How often to refresh the console display

### Testing

Before running the application continuously, it's recommended to run the test script to verify that everything is working correctly:

```python
python src/test.py your_username your_password
```

This will test connectivity to MB Bank, transaction retrieval, weather updates, and Telegram messaging.

### Running on Linux

#### Using the Shell Script

The application can be run directly using the provided shell script:

```bash
chmod +x run_mb_monitor.sh

./run_mb_monitor.sh your_username your_password
```



#### Setting up as a Systemd Service

For continuous operation on Linux, you can set up the application as a systemd service:

1. Edit the `mb-monitor.service` file to update the paths and credentials:

   ```bash
   [Unit]
   
   Description=MB Bank Transaction Monitor
   
   After=network.target
   
   [Service]
   
   Type=simple
   
   User=your_username
   
   WorkingDirectory=/path/to/MBBankTelegram/
   
   ExecStart=/bin/bash /path/to/MBBankTelegram/run_mb_monitor.sh your_mb_username your_mb_password
   
   Restart=always
   
   RestartSec=10
   
   StandardOutput=append:/path/to/MBBankTelegram/mb_monitor_output.log
   
   StandardError=append:/path/to/MBBankTelegram/mb_monitor_error.log
   
   [Install]
   
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

2. Copy the service file to the systemd directory and enable it:

   ```bash
   sudo cp mb-monitor.service /etc/systemd/system/
   
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   
   sudo systemctl enable mb-monitor.service
   
   sudo systemctl start mb-monitor.service
   ```

3. Check the status of the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status mb-monitor.service
   ```

4. View logs:

   ```bash
   # Application logs
   
   tail -f mb_transaction_monitor.log
   
   # Systemd service logs
   
   sudo systemctl status mb-monitor
   ```

## How It Works

### Transaction Monitoring

The application periodically checks for new transactions during configured operating hours. When a new transaction is detected, it:

1. Compares it with the last known transaction stored in `last_transaction.json`
2. If it's a new transaction, formats a notification message
3. Sends the notification to the configured Telegram group
4. Updates the stored transaction record

### Daily Summaries

At the end of the operating hours each day, the application:

1. Retrieves all transactions for the day
2. Calculates the total number of transactions and total amount
3. Formats a summary message
4. Sends it to the Telegram group

### Weather Updates

The application periodically fetches weather information and sends it to the Telegram group:

1. When entering operating hours (morning message)
2. At regular intervals defined by `WEATHER_CHECK_INTERVAL`

### Operating Hours

The application only performs transaction checks during the configured operating hours to reduce unnecessary API calls and potential rate limiting. When entering operating hours, it sends a greeting message, and when exiting, it sends a daily summary followed by a goodnight message.

### Error Handling

The application includes robust error handling:

- Automatic retry for common API errors (503, connection issues)
- Graceful handling of temporary unavailability
- Comprehensive logging of errors and warnings
- Notification of critical errors via Telegram

## Issues, suggestions
Please kindly open an issue and tell me what's on your mind, so I can fix it either improve it..?

## Security Considerations

- The application requires storing your MB Bank credentials either in the service file or as command-line arguments
- Ensure that the files containing your credentials have appropriate permissions
- Consider running the application in a secure, isolated environment
- Be cautious about exposing your Telegram bot token and group ID

## Troubleshooting

- Check the log files (`mb_transaction_monitor.log`) for detailed error information
- Run the test script to verify individual components
- Ensure your MB Bank credentials are correct
- Verify that your Telegram bot has permission to send messages to the group
